Subject: Update on Railway LC Issuance Functionality

Dear [Recipientâ€™s Name],

This is to notify you about an update regarding the issuance of Letters of Credit (LC), specifically pertaining to Railway LC issuance.

Currently, both normal LC issuance and Railway LC issuance share the same status (i.e., status 1), which is why they are available under the same menu. However, with the updated functionality, the status for Railway LC issuance will be changed to 15. Consequently, the Railway LC issuance will have its own separate menu.

Transactions related to Railway LC issuance will henceforth be available in this new menu. Please ensure to update your processes accordingly.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
