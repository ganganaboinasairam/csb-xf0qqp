Subject: Clarification Needed on Outward Bill Lodgment and Bill Nego/Disc Modules

Dear [Recipient's Name],

According to the Solution Document provided, the functionalities for outward bill lodgment and bill negotiation/discounting are mentioned as being within the same module. However, in our existing system, these functionalities are located in two different modules.

Development has been halted due to this discrepancy. Could you please provide clarity on this matter at your earliest convenience?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
