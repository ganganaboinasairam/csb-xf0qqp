**Subject:** Request for Meeting with CS Team to Address CE Development Issues

Dear Suresh,

I hope this email finds you well.

We are currently facing some challenges in CE Development and require assistance from the CS team to overcome them. Could you kindly arrange a meeting with the CS team at the earliest?

The issues we are encountering are as follows:
- Null Pointer Exception while demerging transactions from EE.
- FAP issue when picking transactions from the catalogue in CE.

Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
