**Subject:** Follow-up on CE Development Issues - Awaiting Resolution from CS Team

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope you are doing well.

I would like to bring to your attention that, despite sharing the logs and following up with the CS team, we have not yet received any solution for the issues we are facing in CE Development. 

The key challenges are:
- Null Pointer Exception while demerging transactions from EE.
- FAP issue when picking transactions from the catalogue in CE.

We have already provided the necessary logs and details, but there has been no significant progress. Your assistance in expediting the resolution from the CS team would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
