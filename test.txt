AMQ9245W: Unable to obtain account details for channel MCA user ID.

EXPLANATION:
IBM MQ was unable to obtain the account details for MCA user ID 'MUSR_MQADMIN'.
This user ID was the MCA user ID for channel 'CE.SVRCONN' on queue manager
'CE_DEV_MQ' and may have been defined in the channel definition, or supplied
either by a channel exit or by a client.
ACTION:
Ensure that the user ID is correct and that it is defined on the Windows local
system, the local domain or on a trusted domain. For a domain user ID, ensure
that all necessary domain controllers are available.

AMQ8075W: Authorization failed because the SID for entity 'musr_mqadmin' cannot
be obtained.

EXPLANATION:
The Object Authority Manager was unable to obtain a SID for the specified
entity. This could be because the local machine is not in the domain to locate
the entity, or because the entity does not exist.
ACTION:
Ensure that the entity is valid, and that all necessary domain controllers are
available. This might mean creating the entity on the local machine.

AMQ9557E: Queue Manager User ID initialization failed for 'MUSR_MQADMIN'.

EXPLANATION:
The call to initialize the User ID 'MUSR_MQADMIN' failed with CompCode 2 and
Reason 2035. If an MQCSP block was used, the User ID in the MQCSP block was ''.
If a userID flow was used, the User ID in the UID header was '' and any CHLAUTH
rules applied prior to user adoption were evaluated case-sensitively against
this value.
ACTION:
Correct the error and try again.
