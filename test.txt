Dear Sir,

As per the EE functionality, please note the following points:

**Outward Bill (Non-LC):**
- Multiple amendments are allowed with no restrictions.

**Discounting Non-LC:**
- Amendments can be made only once for the bill amount and bill due date. However, for all other fields, multiple amendments are permitted.
