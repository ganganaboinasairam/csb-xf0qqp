Subject: Clarification Regarding Remote Desktop User Creation

Dear Sir,

I would like to clarify the recent incident regarding the creation of a user account on the Windows server. Since the server allows only one person to access the system at a time, we created an additional user account to enable multiple users to work simultaneously. However, the user account we created did not have the necessary permissions to edit files, and therefore, we deleted the account shortly after it was created.

I hope this explanation addresses the concern, and I apologize for any confusion caused. Please let me know if you require further details.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
